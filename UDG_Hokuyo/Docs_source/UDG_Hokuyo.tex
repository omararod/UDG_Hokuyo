\chapter{Introduction}
This is a c++ implementation of the SCIP 2.0 protocol for Hokuyo products. The current version implements only those commands supported by the UTM-30LX model.\\
\chapter{Setup}
1. Make sure the driver is installed.\\
2. Connect the laser to a 12v DC power source. Typical current consumption goes from 0.8A to 1A. \textbf{WARNING: }Inverting the polarity might cause severe damage to the device, consult the user guide before powering the laser.\\
3. Connect the laser's USB cable to your computer. The device will report itself as a virtual serial port (COMx in Windows, /dev/ttyACMx in linux).\\
\section{Building with UDG\_Hokuyo}
This guide uses Microsoft Visual Studio Express for Desktop 2012 and Windows 8.1 or g++ 4.7 and Ubuntu 13.10. Other compiler/OS/Distribution combnations might work as well but haven't been tested.\\
\subsection{Windows}
1. Copy the UDG\_Hokuyo release folder to a suitable location.\\
2. Open your Visual Studio solution.\\
3. As an optional step, you might want to add UDG\_Hokuyo include (\textless{}Release\_Folder \textgreater\textbackslash{include}) and library (\textless{}Release\_Folder\textgreater\textbackslash{include}\textbackslash{bin}\textbackslash{\textless{}Architecture\textgreater}) directories to your default search folders. To do so, for the include folder go to Project\textbackslash{\textless{}Name\textgreater Properties}\textbackslash{Configuration Properties}\textbackslash{C/C++}\textbackslash{General} and enter the appropriate path in Additional Include Directories. Similarly, for the binary folder edit the Additional library directories property in  Project\textbackslash{\textless{}Name\textgreater{}Properties}\textbackslash{Configuration Properties}\textbackslash{Linker}\textbackslash{General}.\\
4. Your source files should use \#include \textless UDG\_Hokuyo.h\textgreater or \#include ``UDG\_Hokuyo.h''\footnote{Remember that, when using quotes, If the header file is not on your current directory the full path should be included i.e. \#include ``c:\textbackslash{}foo\textbackslash{}bar\textbackslash{}UDG\_Hokuyo.h''.}\\
5. Make sure you're linking with UDG\_Hokuyo.lib. To do so add UDG\_Hokuyo.lib to Additional Dependencies in Project\textbackslash{\textless{}Name\textgreater{}Properties}\textbackslash{Configuration Properties}\textbackslash{Linker}\textbackslash{Input} or add \#pragma comment(lib,``UDG\_Hokuyo.lib'') to your code. \footnote{Use the whole path if you skipped step 3.}\\
 
\subsection{Linux (Ubuntu)}
1. Copy the UDG\_Hokuyo release folder to a suitable location.\\
2. As an optional step you might want to place the header and library files into your default search directories. Typically you'll need to copy \textless{}Release\_Folder\textgreater{}/include/UDG\_Hokuyo.h to /usr/include/ and \textless{}Release\_Folder\textgreater{}/bin/\textless{}Architecture\textgreater{}/libUDG\_Hokuyo.a to /usr/lib.\footnote{These default libraries might vary depending on your compiler settings.}\\
3. Your source files should use \#include \textless UDG\_Hokuyo.h\textgreater or \#include ``UDG\_Hokuyo.h''\footnote{Remember that, when using quotes, If the header file is not on your current directory the full path should be included or you can also use the -I option (see g++ help).}\\
4. To build your application use -std=c++11 \footnote{ -std=c++0x might work as well if you're using an older g++ version} and link with -lUDG\_Hokuyo.a \footnote{Or simply UDG\_Hokuyo.a if you skipped step 2. If the file is not on your current folder you can use its whole path or the -L option (see g++ help).}

\chapter{Code Samples}
The code samples work for the Microsoft c++ compiler (cl, using Visual Studio Express 2012 for desktop) and g++ 3.8. Other compilers might work as well but haven't been tested yet. Windows examples assume an unicode build. \\
\section{Opening a serial port descriptor}
For both Linux and Windows implementations, you need to provide a file descriptor associated with a serial port. The following samples demonstrate how to code a function to do so.\\
textbf{NOTE: }The name of the serial port associated with your board varies from system to system. You'll notice that two virtual communication ports with contiguous numbering will register themselves when connecting the board. You need to use the one with the higher number. Typically this will be COMx for Windows and ttyACMx for linux.\\
\subsection{Windows}
\begin{lstlisting}

HANDLE OpenSerialPort(LPWSTR name)
{
	HANDLE portDescriptor;
	DCB deviceControlBlock;
	portDescriptor = CreateFile(name,
				GENERIC_READ|GENERIC_WRITE,
				0,0,OPEN_EXISTING,0,0);
	if(portDescriptor == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
	{
		printf("Failed opening %ls\n", name);
		return INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE;
	}

	FillMemory(&deviceControlBlock,sizeof(DCB),0);
	deviceControlBlock.DCBlength = sizeof(DCB);
	if(BuildCommDCB(L"57600,n,8,1",&deviceControlBlock))
	{
		printf("Successfully configured DCB!\n");
		
	}
	else
	{
		printf("Something went wrong while building the DCB\n");
		return INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE;
	}

	if (!SetCommState(portDescriptor,&deviceControlBlock))
	{
		printf("Error configuring port\n");
		return INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE;
	}
	else
	{
		printf("Serial port ready\n");
	}
		
	return portDescriptor;
}

\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Linux}
\textbf{NOTE: }In the linux implementation, HANDLE is defined as int.\\
\begin{lstlisting}
int OpenSerialPort(const char* device)
{
	int fd = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY);
	struct termios options;
  tcgetattr(fd, &options);
  options.c_lflag &= ~(ECHO | ECHONL | ICANON | ISIG | IEXTEN);
  options.c_oflag &= ~(ONLCR | OCRNL);
  tcsetattr(fd, TCSANOW, &options);
  return fd;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\section{Typical applications}
\subsection{Get device info}
The SCIP 2.0 protocol provides some commands to get information about the laser such as range, firmware version, running state, serial number, etc. Those functions will return a null terminated char buffer that can be directly printed using operations as printf.\\
\begin{lstlisting}
#include <stdio.h>
#include "UDG_Hokuyo.h"
int main(int nargs, char* args[])
{
#ifdef __linux
char* portName = "/dev/ttyACM0";
#else
	wchar_t *portName = L"COM7";
#endif
	HANDLE port = OpenSerialPort(portName);
	
	
	Hokuyo laser(port);
	unsigned char returnBuffer[HOKUYO_BUFFER_SIZE];

	if(laser.GetRunningState(returnBuffer))
		printf("%s\n",returnBuffer);
	if(laser.GetSpecs(returnBuffer))
		printf("%s\n",returnBuffer);
	if(laser.GetVersionDetails(returnBuffer))
		printf("%s\n",returnBuffer);
	
	
}

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Reading laser data}
A series of operations must be followed in order to read and use depth information from the laser. First you'll need to initialize a Hokuyo instance. You need to provide the Hokuyo::GetData() with information about the encoding (see \ref{sec:encoding}), start and ending steps for it to behave as expected. Once the depth data has been read, it'll be sotred as raw bytes in the buffer provided to Hokuyo::GetData(). To translate this raw depth information  yo can create a LaseData instance and call LaserData::GetData() with the raw buffer as an input parameter. If succesful, this function will intialize the LaserData instance to contain information about the start and end steps, number of measurements performed and an int array (LaserData::data) containing the actual measurements. Remember that each position of the array corresponds to a measurement step, so position 0 maps to step 0,position 1 to step 1 and so on. Each position outside your measurement range (that is, smaller than the start step or greater than the end step) will be set to 0.\\
This example shows how to get some measurements and print them to screen.\\
 \begin{lstlisting}
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include "UDG_Hokuyo.h"
 int main(int nargs, char* args[])
 {
 #ifdef __linux
 char* portName = "/dev/ttyACM0";
 #else
 	wchar_t *portName = L"COM7";
 #endif
 	HANDLE port = OpenSerialPort(portName);
 	
 	
 	Hokuyo laser(port);
 	unsigned char returnBuffer[HOKUYO_BUFFER_SIZE];
 	
 	laser.GetData(HokuyoEncoding::THREE_CHARACTER,
 	HOKUYO_FIRST_MEASUREMENT_POINT,
 	HOKUYO_LAST_MEASUREMENT_POINT-1,
 	0,0,1,returnBuffer);
 	LaserData data;
 	data.SetData(returnBuffer);
 	for(int i = data.firstStep; i <= data.lastStep;i++)
 		printf("%i ",data.data[i]);
 	
 	return 0;
 }
 	
 \end{lstlisting}
